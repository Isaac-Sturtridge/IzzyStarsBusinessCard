                <li>Neptune has no solid surface, meaning you would die by stepping on it</li>
                <li>Neptune's winds blow at 2,100 kmh, meaning you would die from violent acceleration</li>
                <li>Neptune is -218C, meaning you would die from mild hypothermia</li>
                <li>Neptune is 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth is, meaning you would die before seeing those you loved again</li>
                <li>Neptune is in space. It's hard to go to space if you don't have any money. You would die before saving up enough money to go to Neptune</li>
